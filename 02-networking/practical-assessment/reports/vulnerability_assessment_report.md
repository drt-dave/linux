### FINDING #1: SSH Gateway with Password-Only Authentication

**Host:** 192.168.1.1 (Gateway)
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**CVSS Score:** 5.3 (Medium)

#### Description:
The network gateway exposes an SSH service (Dropbear sshd 2019.78) that only supports password authentication. This configuration is vulnerable to brute force and credential stuffing attacks.

#### Technical Details:
```
Port: 22/TCP
Service: SSH
Version: Dropbear sshd 2019.78
Protocol: SSH-2.0
Authentication Methods: password only
Operating System: Linux
```

#### Vulnerability Assessment:
- ✓ Uses SSH-2.0 (not vulnerable SSH-1.0)
- ✗ Password-only authentication (no public key option)
- ⚠ Software version from 2019 (potentially outdated)
- ⚠ No evidence of brute force protection (fail2ban)
- ⚠ Default SSH port (22) increases exposure

#### Evidence:
```bash
$ nmap -p 22 --script ssh-auth-methods 192.168.1.1

PORT   STATE SERVICE
22/tcp open  ssh
| ssh-auth-methods:
|   Supported authentication methods:
|_    password
```

#### Exploitation Scenario:
1. Attacker identifies SSH service on port 22
2. Attacker uses tools like Hydra or Medusa for brute force
3. Attacker tries common passwords or leaked credential databases
4. Successful authentication grants shell access to gateway
5. Attacker pivots to internal network or modifies routing

#### Business Impact:
- **Confidentiality:** HIGH - Full access to gateway configuration
- **Integrity:** HIGH - Attacker can modify routing, DNS, firewall rules
- **Availability:** MEDIUM - Attacker could disable network access

#### Attack Vectors:
- Brute force password attack
- Credential stuffing (using leaked passwords)
- Dictionary attacks
- Default credential testing

#### Proof of Concept:
```bash
# Example brute force command (DO NOT RUN without authorization)
hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://192.168.1.1
```

#### Remediation Steps:

**Priority: HIGH - Implement within 1 week**

1. **Enable Public Key Authentication** (Critical)
   ```bash
   # On router (if supported):
   # Generate key pair on client
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "admin@gateway"

   # Copy public key to gateway
   ssh-copy-id admin@192.168.1.1

   # Configure dropbear to accept keys
   # Add public key to /etc/dropbear/authorized_keys
   ```

2. **Disable Password Authentication**
   ```bash
   # Edit dropbear config
   # Add: -s (disable password logins)
   ```

3. **Implement Brute Force Protection**
   - Install fail2ban or equivalent
   - Configure: 3 failed attempts = 10 minute ban
   - Monitor SSH logs for suspicious activity

4. **Change Default SSH Port**
   ```bash
   # Change SSH port to non-standard (e.g., 2222)
   # Update dropbear config: -p 2222
   ```

5. **Update Dropbear to Latest Version**
   - Check for firmware updates from manufacturer
   - Current: 2019.78 → Latest: Check dropbear.nl
   - Apply security patches

6. **Additional Hardening**
   - Limit SSH access to specific IP addresses
   - Implement VPN for remote access
   - Use strong, unique passwords (if keys not possible)
   - Enable logging and monitoring

#### Verification:
After remediation, verify with:
```bash
nmap -p [new_port] --script ssh-auth-methods 192.168.1.1
# Should show: publickey
```

### FINDING #2: Windows SMB with Optional Message Signing

**Host:** 192.168.1.2 (DRT-DAVE - Windows PC)
**Severity:** MEDIUM-HIGH
**CVSS Score:** 6.5 (Medium)

#### Description:
The Windows host exposes SMB file sharing services with message signing enabled but not required. This configuration allows SMB relay attacks where an attacker can intercept and forward authentication attempts to gain unauthorized access.

#### Technical Details:
```
Ports: 135/TCP (MSRPC), 139/TCP (NetBIOS), 445/TCP (SMB)
Service: Microsoft Windows SMB
NetBIOS Name: DRT-DAVE
Operating System: Microsoft Windows
SMB Protocols: 2.0.2, 2.1.0, 3.0.0, 3.0.2, 3.1.1
Message Signing: Enabled but NOT Required
SMBv1: Disabled (GOOD)
```

#### Vulnerability Assessment:
- ✓ SMBv1 disabled (not vulnerable to EternalBlue)
- ✓ Modern SMB protocols (2.x and 3.x)
- ✓ Authentication required (no null sessions)
- ✗ Message signing not mandatory
- ✗ Multiple network services exposed (RPC, NetBIOS, SMB)
- ⚠ Accessible to entire local network

#### Evidence:
```bash
$ nmap --script smb-security-mode -p 445 192.168.1.2

Host script results:
| smb2-security-mode:
|   3:1:1:
|_    Message signing enabled but not required

| smb-protocols:
|   dialects:
|     2:0:2
|     2:1:0
|     3:0:0
|     3:0:2
|_    3:1:1
```

#### Exploitation Scenario: SMB Relay Attack

**Attack Flow:**
```
1. Attacker runs Responder.py on network (192.168.1.10)
   ↓
2. Responder poisons LLMNR/NBT-NS requests
   ↓
3. Victim (192.168.1.x) tries to access \\backup\share
   ↓
4. Attacker's machine responds to name resolution
   ↓
5. Victim sends authentication to attacker
   ↓
6. Attacker relays authentication to DRT-DAVE (192.168.1.2)
   ↓
7. DRT-DAVE accepts (signing not required)
   ↓
8. Attacker gains unauthorized file access or executes commands
```

**Attack Tools:**
- Responder - LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning
- ntlmrelayx - SMB relay
- Impacket - SMB exploitation toolkit

#### Business Impact:

**Strengths:**
- Modern protocols in use (SMB 2/3, SSH-2.0)
- No critical unpatched vulnerabilities
- Strong authentication requirements (no null sessions)
- Minimal exposed services

**Weaknesses:**
- SMB message signing not required (HIGH PRIORITY)
- SSH password-only authentication (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- Unknown devices on network (INFORMATIONAL)
- Lack of network segmentation

### Risk Statement:

While no immediately exploitable critical vulnerabilities were found, the combination of password-only SSH and optional SMB signing creates **exploitable attack vectors** for determined attackers. The network is **moderately vulnerable** to targeted attacks.

### Recommendations Priority:
